// It actually represents the concept of scope in JavaScript. The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript has three types of scope:
// 1. Global Scope
// 2. Local Scope
// 3. Block Scope

// Scopes is used for visibility of varibales and functions.
// Global Scope: A variable is said to be of global scope when it is declared outside of all functions. It is visible from any function.
// Local Scope: A variable is said to be of local scope when it is declared within a function. It is visible only within that function.it is also known as function scope.
// Block Scope: A variable is said to be of block scope when it is declared within a block. A block is a pair of curly braces {}. It is visible only within that block. It is also known as Lexical scope.

In JavaScript, using `var` to declare a variable allows you to redeclare the same variable multiple times within the same scope without causing an error. This behavior is due to how `var` works in contrast to `let` and `const`.

Here's why you don't get an error with your example:

```javascript
var x = 10;
var x = 20;
console.log(x); // Output: 20
```

1. **Variable Hoisting**: In JavaScript, `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that regardless of where a `var` declaration appears within a function or global scope, it is as if it is declared at the beginning of that scope.

2. **No Block Scope**: Unlike `let` and `const`, which have block-level scoping (scoped to the nearest curly braces `{}`), `var` is scoped to the nearest function or, if declared globally, to the global scope. This lack of block-level scoping allows `var` variables to be redeclared multiple times within the same function or global scope without causing an error.

3. **Declaration and Initialization**: When you write `var x = 10;`, you are both declaring and initializing the variable `x`. When you subsequently write `var x = 20;`, you are effectively redeclaring and reinitializing `x`. JavaScript does not throw an error because it interprets this as simply reassigning the value of the existing variable `x`.

4. **Shadowing**: The second `var x = 20;` statement "shadows" the first one, meaning it declares a new variable `x` in the same scope, effectively overriding the previous value.

However, it's important to note that this behavior of `var` can lead to unexpected results and is generally considered a bad practice in modern JavaScript development due to its lack of block-level scoping and potential for variable hoisting issues. Instead, `let` and `const` should be used for more predictable scoping behavior and to avoid accidental redeclarations.

So, while your code does work without throwing an error, it's not something you should rely on or use in modern JavaScript coding practices.

// This process is called hoisting in JavaScript. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. This means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

// This process is takes place in parsing phase of JavaScript.

Since the variable content is not declared using var, let, or const, it becomes a global variable. Hence, we can access the variable content outside the function fun. But fun should be called before accessing the variable content. If we try to access the variable content before calling the function fun, it will throw a ReferenceError. It is also know as autoglobals.

/* 

Let's break down the JavaScript code step by step to understand its working:

javascript

console.log("first is : " + a());

var a = function(){
  console.log("Hello");
}

function a(){
  console.log("Hi");
}

console.log("second is : " + a());

Step-by-Step Execution

    Function Declarations and Hoisting:
        Function declarations in JavaScript are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means that the function a() declared with function a() { ... } is known to the entire script from the start.
        Variable declarations (var a) are also hoisted, but their assignments are not. This means that the variable a is known from the start, but it is undefined until it is assigned.

    Function Declarations First:
        The function declaration function a() { console.log("Hi"); } is hoisted and takes precedence over the variable declaration var a. Initially, a is a function that logs "Hi".

    First console.log:
        At this point, a is still the function that logs "Hi" because the var a = function() { console.log("Hello"); } assignment hasn't been executed yet.
        So, a() is called, logging "Hi".
        The string concatenation is done, resulting in console.log("first is : " + a());, which logs Hi and then first is : undefined. This happens because a() returns undefined, so the concatenation with "first is : " results in undefined.

    Variable Assignment:
        After the first console.log, the line var a = function() { console.log("Hello"); } is executed. Now, a is reassigned to the new function that logs "Hello".

    Second console.log:
        Now a refers to the function that logs "Hello".
        a() is called, logging "Hello".
        The string concatenation is done, resulting in console.log("second is : " + a());, which logs Hello and then second is : undefined. This happens because a() returns undefined, so the concatenation with "second is : " results in undefined.

Output

Based on the above explanation, the output will be:

csharp

Hi
first is : undefined
Hello
second is : undefined
