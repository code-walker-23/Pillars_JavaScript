/* 


`console.log` and the `console` object are not part of the ECMAScript (JavaScript) language specification itself; they are provided by the host environment, such as web browsers or Node.js. This is why you won't find `console.log` in the ECMAScript specification.

The ECMAScript specification defines the core language features, such as syntax, types, operators, objects, and functions. Host environments, like browsers and Node.js, provide additional objects and functions that are not part of the core language but are essential for interacting with the environment.

In web browsers, the `console` object is part of the Web API provided by the browser. It is defined by the Browser Object Model (BOM), which includes other objects and functions for interacting with the browser, like `window`, `document`, and `alert`.

Here's an example of how you might use `console.log` in a browser environment:

```javascript
// This will log the message to the browser's console
console.log("This is a message to the console");
```

In Node.js, the `console` object is part of the Node.js API, which extends the JavaScript language to include features specific to server-side development.

The separation between the language specification (ECMAScript) and the host environment APIs allows for flexibility and the ability to extend the language with environment-specific features.

he console.log function is a method provided by the JavaScript runtime (such as the V8 engine in Google Chrome or Node.js). It is implemented in C++ within these engines but exposed to JavaScript for developers to use. Here is an overview of how console.log works at a high level:

    JavaScript Layer:
        When you call console.log in JavaScript, the call is routed through the console object which is defined in the JavaScript environment.

    Bindings to Native Code:
        The console.log function is a binding to a C++ function in the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 for Chrome and Node.js). This binding allows JavaScript code to call into native code.

    Native Implementation:
        The native implementation of console.log formats the provided arguments into a human-readable string. It handles different data types (like strings, numbers, objects, etc.) and converts them into a string representation.

    Output:
        The formatted string is then sent to the standard output (stdout), which is typically the terminal or console window where the JavaScript runtime was started. In a browser, this output is directed to the browser's developer console.
